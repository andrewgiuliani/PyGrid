# PyGrid

This is a short Python code that generates two dimensional high order embedded boundary grids.  The code is fast, with most operations are fully vectorized in Numpy.  There are a number of domains already implemented from [1], that include an annulus domain as well as the domain used in Ringleb flow.

## Goal
The goal of this work is to provide an easy to install, high order cut cell grid generator for simple boundary geometries that have a functional representation.  This mesh generator does not handle mesh generecies, nor can it handle all types of cut cells.
